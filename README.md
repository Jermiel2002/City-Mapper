# City-Mapper

The goal of the project is to design an application for public transport that uses a postgreSQL database to manage all the data.

It's up to you the features to implement in your applicationâ€”it is your choice, and your project !

I suggest that you think about what is missing in current apps, and try to add those features to your application.

You must have already covered various pieces of technology needed to do this project:
+ GUI with Qt5Python,
+ connect to postgreSQL with a psycopg2,
+ display and interact with live maps using folium and jinja2,
+ parse CSV data with Python; I also recommend that you use modules pandas or csv to help you for parsing
large and more complex CSV files.
